# Setting Up

- Clone the repo to a desired location and run conky on all the overlays. You can use conky manager or any tool to manage the theme, or [this](https://github.com/AyoItsYas/bin/blob/main/conkyd) simple script should suffice. How you set it up is upto you, I recommend to place the script on your `PATH` and use it as a tool to manage conky themes in general.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AyoItsYas/Mainte.git
  mkdir -p ~/.conky/
  mv ./Mainte/ ~/.conky/

  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AyoItsYas/bin/main/conkyd > conkyd
  chmod +x conkyd
  ./conkyd start
  ```

- For the weather overlay to work you need an API key from https://openweathermap.org/. Configure the enviornment variable `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` with the value.

  ```
  echo 'export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="your_api_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```
